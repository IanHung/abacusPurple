/*
 * This is my manifold it is meant to be a 2d collection of all the information required for a persons project.
 * This representation will change with different metrics.
 * It'll be a collection of: Threads(chat logs), videos, pictures, articles, links, etc( need a full list of etc).  I want drag and drop ability.
 * Basically each collab room would be a sub forum, thus moderators global and local to the collab room.
 * Each Person would have a personal collab room. This collab room is their dashboard, things from other users relevant to their interests get added here.
 * They would also have a personal lab book notebook where they can add random things for themselves. This is sort of a what am I doing app.
 * This app isn't so much about sharing as it is about doing. Things on your dashboard aren't things that are cool that you passively consume
 * they are things you take an active interest in. (note: in many ways this is similar to what tumblr has achieved).
 * In fact much of this could be done on tumblr itself.  So what makes us unique? Datasets and visualization.
 * Productivity addons.  Workflow that begins at your lab book as opposed to your dash board.  Article publication organizing
